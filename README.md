Pocket Crafting for QBX/OX Inventory
Didn't see anything like it so I made this. Its just a simple inventory crafting script, no table or anything, just have the correct items in your inventory. 

First thing i have created so if you have suggestions let me know. 

Create multiple recipes, different animations. 

I am using OX_inventory and QBX Core, although mostly written for QBCORE i just havent tested it on anything other than qbx_core with ox_inventory. Let me know if it works for you. 

Dependencies:
ox_lib
ox_inventory
